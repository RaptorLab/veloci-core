This library is part of Veloci, a framework designed for fast prototyping with a Domain Driven Design methodology.

Actually, it does nothing, but it can be considered a proof of concept for a good design.

Interesting points:
 * It's written in PHP 7.1
 * 100% test coverage
 * Principle Design patterns used
    * Design by contracts
    * Domain Driven Design
    * Test Driven Design
    * SOLID
 
Hope you'll enjoy
